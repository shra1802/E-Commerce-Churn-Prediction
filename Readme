📦 E-Commerce Customer Churn Analysis & Prediction (2025)
📌 Project Overview

Customer retention is critical in e-commerce, where acquiring new customers is significantly more expensive than retaining existing ones.
This project analyzes customer behavior from a synthetic E-Commerce Churn Dataset (2025) to identify churn patterns and build machine learning models that predict customers at risk of leaving the platform.

The project covers Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), feature engineering, churn modeling, and business-driven insights that can help improve customer retention strategies.

🎯 Objectives

Perform detailed exploratory data analysis to understand customer behavior

Define and identify churned customers

Engineer meaningful features for churn prediction

Build and evaluate machine learning models

Analyze churn drivers and high-risk customer segments

Provide actionable business recommendations

🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

The EDA phase focuses on understanding both customer-level and order-level behaviors.

Key Analyses:

Customer demographics (age, gender, country)

Purchase behavior and revenue trends

Subscription status distribution

Cancellation behavior analysis

Time-based analysis (recency and tenure)

Spending patterns by category and geography

Tools Used:

Pandas

Matplotlib

Seaborn

🔄 Churn Definition

A customer is classified as churned if any of the following conditions are met:

subscription_status == "Cancelled"

The customer has not made a purchase within a defined inactivity period (recency threshold)

This definition combines behavioral inactivity and explicit churn signals, aligning with real-world business scenarios.

🛠 Feature Engineering

Key engineered features include:

Recency: Days since last purchase

Frequency: Purchase frequency per year

Monetary Value: Total and average customer spend

Tenure: Time since signup

Cancellation Intensity: Number of canceled orders

Categorical Encoding: Gender, country, category

🤖 Machine Learning Models

The following models were implemented and compared:

Model	Purpose
Logistic Regression	Baseline, interpretable model
Random Forest	Non-linear model capturing complex patterns
Evaluation Metrics:

Accuracy

Precision

Recall

F1-Score

ROC-AUC

Feature importance analysis was performed to identify the strongest churn drivers.

📊 Key Insights

Customers with low purchase frequency and high recency are more likely to churn

Higher cancellation counts strongly correlate with churn

Certain product categories show higher churn risk

High-value customers exhibit lower churn but higher revenue impact when lost

💡 Business Recommendations

Implement targeted retention campaigns for high-risk customers

Offer incentives to customers with declining purchase frequency

Monitor cancellation behavior as an early churn signal

Personalize engagement based on customer segment and category preference
